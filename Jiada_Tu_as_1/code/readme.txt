If OSX:
	type the command "cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ." in the terminal, then type "make"
If windows:
	make a new project, copy the "win.cpp" to the project, compile and run (include the OpenCV head file and lib)
	
Since the Timer.cpp doesn't work on windows, I didn't include it in the win.cpp, but in osx.cpp
