Use command line “./findPoint” to execute findPoint, or the files may be saved to unknown paths.

Since the RANSAC algorithm is modified a little when compute iteration parameter k, if the input data is not coplanar or not good enough(too much noise) or distorted, it may take long time(<1 minute) for my calibration program to get the result.
