Assignment Specifications</a>
</h2>

<p>
In this assignment you need to implement one of several stereo vision
algorithms: locating and drawing epipolar lines of an uncalibrated
stereo pair, structure reconstruction from an uncalibrated stereo pair,
or rectification of an uncalibrated stereo pair.

</p><ul>
<li>The input image should always be converted to grayscale before
  processing it.
</li>
<li>The main parameters of each algorithm should be made available
  for interactive manipulation through keyboard/mouse/trackbar
  interaction.
</li>
<li>You may NOT use the OpenCV function which directly implements
  the algorithm you choose. You may, however, use it for verification
  purposes. You may use other OpenCV functions as necessary.
</li>
<li>Your program must include a help key describing its functionality.
</li>
<li>You need to evaluate the performance of the algorithm you choose
  using test data. The results of your evaluation should be included in
  your report. Try to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the
  algorithm.
</li>
<li>For submission instructions and the necessary format of the
  report please refer to assignment 1.
</li>
</ul>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00002000000000000000">
Epipolar lines estimation</a>
</h2>

<p>

</p><ul>
<li>Given a stereo pair as the command line argument to the program,
  load and the display the images next to each other.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>The user is then allowed to specify a set of corresponding
  points in the images using the mouse.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Using the set of corresponding points specified by the user,
  estimate the fundamental matrix relating the two views and display the
  estimated matrix. Normalize the points before computing
  the fundamental matrix and make sure that the estimated fundamental
  matrix is a rank 2 matrix.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Using the estimated fundamental matrix, let the user select a
  point in one image, and display the corresponding epipolar line in the
  second image. The user should be able to select points in both the left
  and right images.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Using the estimated fundamental matrix, compute and display
  (numerically) the coordinates of the left and right epipoles.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Test stereo images are available on the cs512 website. In
  addition, test the algorithm on images you take yourself.

<p>
</p></li>
</ul>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00003000000000000000">
Model reconstruction</a>
</h2>

<p>

</p><ul>
<li>Given a set of two views in which the intrinsic camera
  parameters are KNOWN (the extrinsic camera parameters are assumed
  UNKNOWN), and a set of corresponding points in the two views,
  reconstruct 3D points on the surface of the unknown object. 

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Using a subset of the provided corresponding points, estimate
  the fundamental matrix relating the two views and display the
  estimated matrix. Make sure that the estimated fundamental matrix has
  a rank of 2. Using the knowledge of the intrinsic parameters compute
  and display the essential matrix. 

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Using the essential matrix, estimate up to an unknown sign the
  rotation and translation between the views and display them. Note that
  the true extrinsic parameters are provided so that you can verify your
  computations.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Reconstruct the 3D points using the obtained rotation and
  translation and choose a consistent solution.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>The corresponding points are described in a text file. The first
  line in this file contains the number of matched points. Subsequent
  lines contain the description of pairs of corresponding points. Each
  pair of corresponding points is described by 4 coordinates: <img width="24" height="33" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./CS-512 - Assignment 4 (5%)_files/img1.png" alt="$x_r$">,
  <img width="22" height="33" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./CS-512 - Assignment 4 (5%)_files/img2.png" alt="$y_r$">, <img width="21" height="33" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./CS-512 - Assignment 4 (5%)_files/img3.png" alt="$x_l$">, <img width="20" height="33" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./CS-512 - Assignment 4 (5%)_files/img4.png" alt="$y_l$">, where <img width="61" height="37" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./CS-512 - Assignment 4 (5%)_files/img5.png" alt="$(x_r,y_r)$"> and <img width="56" height="37" align="MIDDLE" border="0" src="./CS-512 - Assignment 4 (5%)_files/img6.png" alt="$(x_l,y_l)$"> are
  corresponding points.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>The reconstructed points should be saved in a VRML file as a 3D
  point cloud and rendered using an external VRML viewer
  (alternatively, write a simple OpenGl program to display the points 
  which allows for rotating the points and zooming in/out).
  Generation surfaces between the points is not required.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>A calibrated image pair with a dense correspondence and known
  intrinsic/extrinsic parameters is available on the cs512 website. In
  addition, test the algorithm on images you take yourself.

<p>
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00004000000000000000">
Rectification</a>
</h2>

<p>

</p><ul>
<li>Given a stereo pair as the command line argument to the program,
  load and the display the images next to each other.
  The user is then allowed to specify a set of corresponding
  points in the images using the mouse.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Using the set of corresponding points specified by the user,
  estimate the fundamental matrix relating the two views and display the
  estimated matrix. Make sure that the estimated fundamental matrix is a
  rank 2 matrix.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Given the KNOWN intrinsic parameters of the camera, determine
  the essential matrix relating the views. Using the essential matrix,
  estimate up to an unknown sign the rotation and translation between the
  views and display them. Assume that the correct sign is given to you
  (the true extrinsic parameters are provided for verification purposes). 

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Using the ESTIMATED extrinsic parameters and the KNOWN intrinsic
  parameters compute and the display the rectification transformation
  matrix that has to be applied to the left and right views.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>Apply the estimated transformations to warp the left and right
  views and display the resulting images next to each other.

<p>
</p></li>
<li>A calibrated image pair with known intrinsic/extrinsic
  parameters is available on the cs512 website. In
  addition, test the algorithm on images you take yourself.
