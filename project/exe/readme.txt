Use command line “./Panorama [dir_path]” to execute the program. 

[dir_path] must end with “/“.
For example:”./Panorama ./../data/testImage1/”

[dir_path] is the path of a directory which only contains the image files that need to be stitching. All images must be in the panorama(no outliers). The result panorama.png will be produce in that directory. 

The program may take some time to calculate the result, please wait.
